# Genetic Itemization
Genetic algorithm based role-game itemizer. Instituto Tecnol√≥gico de Buenos Aires. Q1-2020
## How to run
### Clone into IDE
As simple as that, keep the file structure as is and you should have no problem
### JAR
In the executables folder theres a .jar to run the project, make sure there is a valid properties file named "config.properties" at the same level as the .jar. The equipment files ("armas.tsv", "botas.tsv", "cascos.tsv", "guantes.tsv", "pecheras.tsv") must be at the same level too. To execute just run:
`java -jar GeneticItemization.jar`

In order to generate charts, all provided files in our project (now located in src/files) must be in src/files while the .jar must be at the same level as 'src' folder. To execute just run:
`java -jar Grapher.jar`
And follow the instructions.

## Config file options
### characterClass
- 1 - Warrior (default)
- 2 - Archer
- 3 - Support
- 4 - Spy

### crossover
- 1 - Single Point Crossover (default)
- 2 - Two Point Crossover
- 3 - Annular Crossover
- 4 - Uniform Crossover

### mutation
- 1 - Individual Gen Mutation (default)
- 2 - Multigen Mutation
- 3 - Uniform Multigen Mutation
- 4 - Complete Mutation

### mutationStyle
- 0 - Randomized (default)
- 1 - Small Mutation

### selection1 (a% of the generated children will be selected with this method)
- 1 - Elite Selection (default)
- 2 - Roulette Selection
- 3 - Universal Selection
- 4 - Boltzmann Selection
- 5 - Deterministic Tournaments Selection
- 6 - Probabilistic Tournaments Selection
- 7 - Ranking Selection

### selection2 ((1-a)% of the generated children will be selected with this method)
Same as `selection1`

### replacement1 (b% of the next generation will be selected with this method)
- 1 - Elite Selection (default)
- 2 - Roulette Selection
- 3 - Universal Selection
- 4 - Boltzmann Selection
- 5 - Deterministic Tournaments Selection
- 6 - Probabilistic Tournaments Selection
- 7 - Ranking Selection

### replacement2 ((1-b)% of the next generation will be selected with this method)
Same as `replacement1`

### implementation
- 1 - Fill All Implementation (default)
- 2 - Fill Parent Implementation

### endCriteria
- 1 - Time Criteria (default)
- 2 - Generation Quantity Criteria
- 3 - Acceptable Solution Criteria
- 4 - Struct Criteria
- 5 - Content Criteria

### a
Double value used in `selection1` and `selection2`

### b
Double value used in `replacement1` and `replacement2`

### populationSize
Integer value which represents the population size

### mutationProbability
Double value which represents the probability of a gen being mutated

### stopTime
Integer value used in `Time Criteria` to set the finish time

### maxGeneration
Integer value used in `Generation Quantity Criteria` to set the desired quantity of generations

### targetPopulationPerformance
Integer value used in `Acceptable Solution Criteria` to set the total population performance goal

### generationsNotChanging
Integer value used in `Struct Criteria` and `Content Criteria` to set how many consecutive  generations with a given value within `tolerance`'s range are to be found before completion. In `Struct Criteria` this value is the generation's total performance, in `Content Criteria` it's the generation's best performing individual.

### tolerance
Double value used in `Struct Criteria` and `Content Criteria` coupled with `generationsNotChanging` to set maximium diference between the current generation and the previous one. 

### initialTemperature
Double value used in `Boltzmann Selection` to set the initial temperature of the system
